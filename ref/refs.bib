  abstract  = {Transmission control protocol (TCP), the almost universally used reliable transport protocol in the Internet, has been engineered to perform well in wired networks where packet loss is mainly due to congestion. TCP throughput, however, degrades over wireless links, which are characterized by a high and greatly varying bit error rate and by intermittent connectivity. Over such wireless links, the performance achieved by TCP can be improved through the use of cross-layer algorithms at the link-level, which interact with the TCP state machine. In this paper, a TCP-aware dynamic ARQ algorithm is therefore proposed, which utilizes TCP timing information to prioritize ARQ packet retransmissions. Numerical investigation of the proposed algorithm demonstrates the performance improvements that can be attained through this approach, in comparison with TCP-agnostic link-layer approaches.},

In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix (i.e., code) packets from different sources to increase the information content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in the theory of network coding. Prior work on network coding is mainly theoretical and focuses on multicast traffic. This paper aims to bridge theory with practice; it addresses the common case of unicast traffic, dynamic and potentially bursty flows, and practical issues facing the integration of network coding in the current network stack. We evaluate our design on a 20-node wireless network, and discuss the results of the first testbed deployment of wireless network coding. The results show that using COPE at the forwarding layer, without modifying routing and higher layers, increases network throughput. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on the traffic pattern, congestion level, and transport protocol.},

The algorithm has the feature that the encoding process is truly online, as opposed to a block-by-block approach. The setup assumes a packet erasure broadcast channel with stochastic arrivals and full feedback, but the proposed scheme is potentially applicable to more general lossy networks with link-by-link feedback. The algorithm guarantees that the physical queue size at the sender tracks the backlog in degrees of freedom (also called the virtual queue size). The new notion of a node ldquoseeingrdquo a packet is introduced. In terms of this idea, our algorithm may be viewed as a natural extension of ARQ schemes to coded networks. Our approach, known as the drop-when-seen algorithm, is compared with a baseline queuing approach called drop-when-decoded. It is shown that the expected queue size for our approach is O[(1)/(1-rho)] as opposed to Omega[(1)/(1-rho)2] for the baseline approach, where rho is the load factor.},

Building on recent work by Li et al.(see Proc. 2001 IEEE Int. Symp. Information Theory, p.102), who examined the network capacity of multicast networks, we extend the network coding framework to arbitrary networks and robust networking. For networks which are restricted to using linear network codes, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of any given set of connections over a given network. We also consider the problem of network recovery for nonergodic link failures. For the multicast setup we prove that there exist coding strategies that provide maximally robust networks and that do not require adaptation of the network interior to the failure pattern in question. The results are derived for both delay-free networks and networks with delays.},

  abstract  = {Providing reliable and efficient networking services in wireless ad hoc networks is extremely challenging due to high mobility and unstable wireless nature: a significant number of packets can be corrupt or lost. To increase the reliability in packet erasure networks, various coding schemes have been proposed. Network coding (NC) and erasure coding (EC) are such well-known coding techniques recently considered to be used for multicast communications. Both schemes are able to encode original packets into a potentially infinite data stream of encoded packets. Receivers can reconstruct the original packets once they have collected a certain number of encoded packets. The main difference of these schemes is that NC allows intermediate nodes to encode packets they have received so far whereas EC is an end-to-end coding which allows only sources to encode. Both schemes are considered to be able to provide excellent ammunition against erasure networks. However, dasiathe jury is still outpsila regarding which scheme is suitable in ad hoc networks. In this paper, based on simulations and analysis study, we present information on the performance of both schemes which may be useful for selecting the better coding scheme.},

The key ingredient of CodeCast is random network coding, which transparently implements both localized loss recovery and path diversity with very low overhead. Simulation results show that in a typical setting, CodeCast yields a nearly 100 percent delivery ratio, as compared to a 94 percent delivery ratio by traditional multicast. More importantly, the overhead is reduced by as much as 50 percent},

Assuming that the sender is providing the same data to multiple receivers over independent packet erasure channels, we focus on the case of perfect feedback and heterogeneous erasure probabilities. Based on a general analytical framework for evaluating the decoding delay, we show that existing ARQ schemes fail to ensure that receivers with weak channels are able to recover from packet losses within reasonable time. To overcome this problem, we re-define the encoding rules in order to break the chains of linear combinations that cannot be decoded after one of the packets is lost. Our results show that sending uncoded packets at key times ensures that all the receivers are able to meet specific delay requirements with very high probability.},

We define a loss differentiation scheme to adjust R, based on the Vegas Loss Predictor and the collective feedback information of ACKs and duplicates ACKs, which are both indicators of the network condition. In that way the source adjusts R based on the network conditions, avoiding unnecessary TCP rate reduction linked to packet losses due to transmission impairments and preventing the network from entering in a congestion state. The TPC/NC implementation with our adaptive scheme is full-duplex, and can manage multiple TCP connections simultaneously. Simulation results over realistic network scenarios using OPNET Modeler show that our adaptive scheme in conjunction with the standard TCP/NC produces better TCP-throughputs than the standard TCP/NC, TCP-Reno, TPC New Reno, and TCP Reno with SACKS.},

Network coding over a large finite field size has been shown to be a theoretically efficient solution to the index coding problem. However the high computational complexity of packet encoding and decoding over a large finite field size, and its subsequent penalty on encoding and decoding throughput and higher energy cost makes it unsuitable for practical implementation in processor and energy constraint devices like mobile phones and wireless sensors. While network coding over GF(2) can alleviate these concerns, it comes at a tradeoff cost of degrading throughput performance. To address this tradeoff, we propose a throughput optimal triangular network coding scheme over GF(2). We show that such a coding scheme can supply unlimited number of innovative packets and the decoding involves the simple back substitution. Such a coding scheme provides an efficient solution to the index coding problem and its lower computation and energy cost makes it suitable for practical implementation on devices with limited processing and energy capacity.},

Network nodes independently and randomly select linear mappings from inputs onto output links over some field. We show that this achieves capacity with probability exponentially approaching 1 with the code length. We also demonstrate that random linear coding performs compression when necessary in a network, generalizing error exponents for linear Slepian-Wolf coding in a natural way. Benefits of this approach are decentralized operation and robustness to network changes or link failures. We show that this approach can take advantage of redundant network capacity for improved success probability and robustness. We illustrate some potential advantages of random linear network coding over routing in two examples of practical scenarios: distributed network operation and networks with dynamically varying connections. Our derivation of these results also yields a new bound on required field size for centralized network coding on general multicast networks},

  abstract  = {The performance of the transmission control protocol (TCP) with loss-based congestion control is considerably degraded in lossy networks (e.g., wireless networks). Implementing a network coding (NC) with TCP (TCP/NC) helps prevent this performance degradation by introducing lost packet recovery capability without retransmission at a sink by sending redundant combination packets encoded at the source. TCP/NC can recover random lost packets. However, TCP/NC is less effective when burst packet losses occur because it requires packet retransmission and the retransmission mechanism of the standard TCP/NC entirely relies on the TCP layer. To improve the goodput of a system, we propose a new mechanism in the NC layer called forward retransmission that can retransmit more than one lost packet simultaneously and efficiently. We simulated the proposed mechanism using Network Simulator 3. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the goodput of a system compared with the standard TCP/NC and TCP NewReno in a burst loss channel.},
